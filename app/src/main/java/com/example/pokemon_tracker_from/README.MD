TODO list
-connect save button to content provider
-Do NOT allow for duplicates. You should Check that there is not an entry on the database
with the same values as the ones entered [5 points]
-Instead of making the TextView background red, you may alert the user of an error
however you want to, just make sure that its user-friendly (DO NOT do a million Toasts
back to back!) [5 points]
-Allow for deleting a transaction from the database [5 points]
    You can handle this however you like, just make it user-friendly (e.g., a long press shows a context
    menu with the option to delete)
